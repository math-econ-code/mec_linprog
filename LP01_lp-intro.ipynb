    "\n",
    "* Nutritionists have identified a number of vital nutrients (calories, protein, calcium, iron, etc.) that matter for a person's health, and have determined the minimum daily intake of each nutrient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each basic food (pasta, butter, bread, etc), nutritionists have characterized the intake in each of the various nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each food has a unit cost, and the problem is to find the optimal diet, i.e. the combination of foods that meets the minimal intake in each of the nutrients and achieves minimal cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was taken on by G. Stigler, who published a paper about it in 1945, giving a first heuristic solution, exhibiting a diet that costs \\\\$ 39.93 per year in 1939 dollars. Later (in 1947) it was one of the first\n",
    "application of G.B. Dantzig's method (the simplex algorithm), which provided the exact solution (\\$39.67). It then took 120 man-day to perform this operation. However today the computer will perform it for us in a\n",
    "fraction of second.\n",
